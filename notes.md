# global optimal traits notes

## june 16, 2025
- recently updated optimal vcmax code to include Rd
- now want to run model globally for deciduous and evergreen C3 plants and produce
interpretable PCA plots
	- problems
		1. LMA not set up to do evergreen option
			- **FIXED!**
		2. no input for "f" for deciduous LMA
			- **FIXED!**
- next steps
	- make plots with deciduous and evergreen and correct traits
		- need to think about best traits to look at
